# Products and Coproducts

This chapter cover very interesting properties about morphims before introducing Products.

In very short : 
> Empty set as Void like an initial object

> Singleton as unit () like a terminal object

> Duality, the heart of product and coproduct

> Isomophism and so on...

We will introduce product factorizers and finally coproducts. 
This chapter explain very well this principles and I will not explain it better than the author.

The end of this chapter is interesting by exposing differences between product and coproduct properties (bijective or not)
