# Products and Coproducts

This chapter cover very interesting properties about morphims before introducing Products.

In very short : 
 | Empty set as Void like an initial object
 | Singleton as unit () like a terminal object
 | Duality, the heart of product and coproduct
 | Isomophism and so on...

We will introduce product factorizers and finally coproducts.

The end of this chapter is interesting by exposing difference between product and coproduct properties (bijective or not)
