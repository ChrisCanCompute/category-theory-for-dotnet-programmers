# Simple Algebraic Data Types

This chapter explains well what is a Sum and Product types and how we could use them together.

## Personal notes
In csharp we often use Subtyping as Sum type. There is 2 things in Sum types : the total one, where the compiler checks that
each case is treated (Discriminated union in fsharp, can't do that now in csharp) and the open one (partial) with Subtype.
